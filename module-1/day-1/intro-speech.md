    - general advices: 
        - web dev is a excellent career path, but it requires real skills (not a bs job)
        - the emotianal rollercoaster is real, don't fear it, embrace it, it's part of the process
        - the curriculum is dense, expect no social life for 2 months (yay lockdown soon)
        - expect frustration (feeling lost, overwhelmed, stressed, etc.)
        - expect nose bleed (technical difficulties)
        - don't compare yourself with others : it's a fight against yourself ;)
            - during the class, during the labs, during the group projects
        - ask questions : there is NO SUCH THING as a "stupid question"
        - just wait the proper moment please ;)
        - take some notes : notebook, cheat-sheets, notion, google doc's, your call

        - reading the lesson the day before is better :

          - cause you can come with precise questions
        - developer : find a path from A -> Z
        - ... don't forget to sleep ;)
